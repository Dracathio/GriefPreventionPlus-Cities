#GriefPreventionPlus-Cities

This is an extension for GriefPreventionPlus (a custom version of GriefPrevention) that adds cities.
It aims to be a substitute for MyTown on 1.7+ servers.

GriefPreventionPlus is needed to make GriefPreventionPlus-Cities work!

##Features
- Cities list
- Create new cities or join existing one (1)(2)
- Assign plots to your citizen or let them choose a plot!
- City spawn (by default, you can teleport to other cities too!)
- Custom messages when you enter a claim/city/plot
- People can join a city without an invite (3)
- A new citizen can choose a preset plot (4)
- Individual citizen permissions for invite, expel, etc...
- Citizens group permission: you can trust all your citizens on a plot with a single command
- Citizens can add people to their own plot (they can use /trust command)
- City chat (admin tools included (5))
- ... and more!

1. if you just want to protect your base, it's not necessary to make a city, but just a GP claim!
2. even if you're part of a city, you can still make GP'sclaim out of the city
3. the mayor can set his city as joinable, so new people can check the city list and join a city without an invitation
4. the mayor needs to mark those plots with the autoclaim command
5. chat log and social spy

##Planned features
- Nations
- Taxes: no claim loose if the player doesn't pay, but disable commands like /spawn
- Get claimable blocks for every new citizen
- Tab completer! (everyone hates players with long and hard to type names... xD)

##Commands:
- /city /c - main city command (/c help for the help)
- /citychat /cc - use the city chat
- /cityadmin /ca - use the city admin commands

##Requirements
This plugin requires GriefPreventionPlus. http://github.com/KaiKikuchi/GriefPreventionPlus

##Support my life!
I'm currently unemployed and I'm studying at University (Computer Science).
I'll be unable to continue my studies soon because I need money.
