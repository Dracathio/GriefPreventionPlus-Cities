#GriefPreventionPlus-Cities

Grief Prevention is the best plugin to protect stuff.
It's very easy to use and it works pretty well.

Unlike other plugins like MyTown, it doesn't offer a system that 
At this moment, there is no MyTown for Minecraft 1.7.10 and greater. In my opinion, MyTown is harder than GriefPrevention.

With GPP-Cities you can have both the powerful and easy to use Grief Prevention and a cool and customizable cities plugin!

Unfortunately, Grief Prevention has some API limitation that made impossible to implements lots of important features.
Grief Prevention has some performance issue too. That's why I decided to fork Grief Prevention and make GriefPreventionPlus.

GriefPreventionPlus is needed to make GriefPreventionPlus-Cities work!

1. if you just want to protect your base, it's not necessary to make a city, but just a GP claim!
2. even if you're part of a city, you can still make GP'sclaim out of the city
3. the mayor can set his city as joinable, so new people can check the city list and join a city without an invitation
4. the mayor needs to mark those plots with the autoclaim command
5. chat log and social spy

##Planned features
- Nations
- Taxes: no claim loose if the player doesn't pay, but disable commands like /spawn
